      "- (2) A similar sampling and sequencing effort for Piura chilensis, a native tunicate that inhabits the Chilean coast. What do you think to perform a comparative transcriptome analysis? Both species and populations were sampled at the same time and localities.   \n",

      "Interestingly, the larvae of P. chilensis have a limited potential to disperse long distances, meanwhile C. concholepas larvae can swim for 2 or 3 months. Some working questions could be, Are there differences in GO terms among species and populations? Species with lower potential dispersion has higher frequency of SNPs? Are the mutations linked to genes with specific biological function or specie-specific? Furthermore, I have the oceanographic information such as temperature variation, chlorophyl, winds, etc. "
